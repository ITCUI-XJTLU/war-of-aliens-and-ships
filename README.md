# **The War of aliens and ships**  
## Introduction:  
As the first complete project of python I have made, the project provide me a deeper insight of 
Object-Oriented Programming style, which is important and meaningful for the fresh programmers like me . 
When we write a simple script , we have tittle access to find the beauty and advantages of OOP . However , when 
we try to develop a complex project , OOP can help us organize the program in an efficient and perfect way .     
  
  
  
## Run:  
#### Prerequisites:
* python >= 3.6
* pygame 
* sys
  
#### Play the game :   
* Download the whole project .Since it is a complete project , it is strongly recommend you to run the project by you local environment , such Pycharm .  
* Change the pictures path in ___ship.py___ and ___alien.py___ , I use absolute path , so you need to change it .  
* Run the ***alien_invasion.py*** file ,and enjoy your game .   
  
#### Game effect:  
   
     
## Improve:
Actually , I think the project can be improved in some ways, so I may update the project in the future :
* Since I use ___pygame.sprite___ to organize the aliens , so the aliens have to appear in a rectange way . So I want 
to change to another function which can organize the different aliens move in different and random ways .
   
* When I write the game , I just set the ships move left or right to decrease the difficult of the codes. So in 
the future , I want to set ships move to four directions . And the experience of playing the game can probably be improved .
